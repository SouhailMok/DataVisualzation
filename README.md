## Summary 

In this data visualization I want to share with users some interesting information about Titanic passengers and the chance to survive to this tragic event.

My first version I liked to show is the answer to some questions when I had a quick reading of the data source: "Did the passengers without cabin inside Titanic, have more chance to survive? Is it true whatever the age? Before making a chart, I imagined that passengers, who were inside cabins, were sleeping and not able to hear what is going on, so more likely to die that day. 

 Here below the first chart I have developed:

I got several feedbacks about this chart and decided to go deeper in my analyse.

## Design

To design the graph I used Dimple.js because it permits me to implement easily the grammar of graphics via simple functions and several types of chart. To represent my finding, I chose a bar chart, because I wanted only to compare the amount of survivors and non-survivors in each category. Dimple provides user friendly charts colors, however, I changed the default colors because it confused the end users (as explained in Feedbacks below). I also used colored legends to help users to find quickly the information. Finaly, I provided a menu composed of buttons to give the user more interaction with graph and permit him/her to explore and compare several categories for more information, in addtion to some improvment on the titles of the chart and axes.

## Feedback 
 I asked some colleagues and friends to comment my first version of the chart and got the following feebacks:
