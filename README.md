## Summary 

In this data visualization I want to share with users some interesting information about Titanic passengers and the chance to survive to this tragic event.

My first version I liked to show is the answer to some questions when I had a quick reading of the data source: "Did the passengers without cabin inside Titanic, have more chance to survive? Is it true whatever the age? Before making a chart, I imagined that passengers, who were inside cabins, were sleeping and not able to hear what is going on, so more likely to die that day. 

 Here below the first chart that I have developed:

## Design

To design the graph I used Dimple.js because it permits me to implelent the grammar of graphics easily via simple functions and several types of chart. To represent my finding, I chose a bar chart, because I wanted only to compare the amount of survivors
